~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OVERVIEW
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This set of scripts is designed to run on your own webserver, in order
to allow you to easily store and retrieve information from Second Life
using the llHTTPRequest() function.  It allows you to store data per 
Second Life user in field/data pairs.  You don't have to use it this
way, but that's what it was designed for.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DOCUMENTATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each record stored has three variables:  KEY, FIELD, VALUE.

	KEY - 	The key variable is generally designed to store data by SL 
		  	user keys or uuids. You can use any unique string as a 
		  	key value, but that's what it was designed for.
	FIELD - This is an identifier for the data you're storing.
	VALUE - And this is the actual information you want to store.
	
For instance, if you were using this to store a user's preferences
for prim shoes, you might want to store the following fields: color,
size, and laces. Assuming the user has selected an unlaced, size 8, 
red shoe, you would store these as three separate records:

				<user key>, color, <1,0,0>
				<user key>, size, 8
				<user key>, laced, no

where <user key> is the user's uuid.  

This is about as flexible a storage solution as I could come up with 
without getting into your individual needs.  If you need something more 
flexible, you should write your own script (or hire somebody else to).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WHAT YOU'LL NEED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need your own hosting account with PHP/MySQL. If you don't
know what those are, go learn and come back when you do. Typically
speaking, you can find PHP/MySQL hosting on the cheap (less than $5/mo)
all over the place (I recommend http://www.site5.com).  

Most of the detailed instructions here assume you're running a hosting 
account with cPanel, but that's just because I'm lazy and can't be
bothered to learn about other shared hosting setups.  As long as your 
account has PHP and MySQL, you're good to go - read the documentation 
on your hosting account to learn how to set up your MySQL database.

You'll also need an FTP client of some kind (or cPanel's File Manager)
and how to use it. It probably wouldn't hurt to learn how to use 
phpMyAdmin either, but you don't need it to set up this script.

You don't need your own domain name, but this guide assumes you have
one, so you'll need to adjust the instructions accordingly.  Also,
domain names are only $10, so cough up and get one, you cheap bastard.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This part looks really long, but that's because there's a lot of extra
details added in for folks who are new to this stuff.  If you've ever
installed Wordpress, it's mostly the same stuff, only with less files
to upload and less stuff to fill out.

STEP 1: CREATE A MYSQL DATABASE AND USER

You'll need to create a MySQL database and a user account to manage that
database.  If you're on a cPanel account, this is best accomplished by
clicking the "MySQL Database Wizard" icon. Otherwise, follow your
hosting service's instructions.

You should give your user full privileges to the database you create
(at the very least SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE). Then make a
note of the database name, the user name, and the password. 

IMPORTANT: If you have a cPanel account, you should know that your 
database name is actually a combination of your login name and the 
name you chose. The same is true of your database username.  So if 
your username is "dimwit" and you create a database named "sldb" and 
a user named "sldbadmin" the actual names are "dimwit_sldb" and 
"dimwit_sldbadmin," respectively.

Let's assume your database details are as follows:

			Database Name: dimwit_sldb
			Database User: dimwit_sldbadmin
			Database Pass: sekret
			
Okay, you're ready.  Let's move on to...


STEP 2: EDIT THE FILES

Unzip the files in this package (though chances are you've already done
that if you're reading this README) and open "config.php" in your fave
plain text editor (if you open it in Microsoft Word, I'll punch you
in the mouth).

Fill out the values listed in that file with the database details you
just created.  For the most part, you don't need to change "localhost."

You can also select a database table name, though it's really not
necessary.  You can leave the default of "sldb_data."

In fact, if you know enough about PHP/MySQL to NEED to change that
value, you should probably be writing your own solution rather than
using my crappy one.


STEP 3: UPLOAD THE FILES

Upload the three files (config.php, data.php, and install.php) to a
folder on your webserver.  Note the location of this.  For the purposes 
of this guide, we'll assume it's this:
				
					http://www.example.com/sldb/

You don't have to call the folder sldb, but remember the name of it. 

Typically speaking, this folder should go in the /www/ or /public_html/ 
folder (different for some hosts).


STEP 4: RUN INSTALL.PHP

Visit install.php on your server (in our example, it should be at
http://www.example.com/sldb/install.php).  Confirm that you want
to install the table.

IMPORTANT: Don't install twice.  If data already exists in that
table, running install.php will wipe it clean.

Once you're done installing the table, delete the install.php file,
like, immediately.


STEP 5: HAVE A MOJITO.  YOU'RE DONE.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
USAGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you're all uploaded and stuff, you can store and retrieve data
from http://www.example.com/sldb/data.php using llHTTPRequest() (or cURL,
but if you knew cURL you probably wouldn't need this, so I'll skip that
stuff).

The fastest way to use this is by using the example.lsl script included
in this package.  This script includes four custom functions you can
call to store/retrieve/delete data in various ways.  Just copy the
functions into the top of your LSL script (along with a couple of
required variables) and you'll be ready to go, or use the example to 
make your own adjustments.

However, it's good, on the whole, to know how the system works, so
we're including a guide here:
